      <h1>Australia's 2019 BushFire</h1>
      <p>In 2019, the largest Australian forest fire in history sounded the alarm. <br>The fire that lasted for nearly half a year not only engulfed the lives of tens of thousands of local animals but also caused almost irreversible effects.

      <h3>Energy Resources</h3>
      <p class="forest-text">At the same time, as a valuable forest energy (wood energy), it can also be traditional non-renewable energy, such as coal, or non-polluting clean renewable energy. It is one of the most valuable energy sources that has received international attention.

      <h3>Carbon Cycle</h3>
      <p class="forest-text">Also, climate change is a global crisis, It will bring serious ecological and environmental problems, and the forest ecosystem plays a very important role in the carbon cycle, and can absorb many greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.</p>

    </div>
   <p class="forest-text">Forests are important economic and environmental assets. As forestry products, they can generate economic value. As living things, they can fix carbon dioxide. In addition, replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy can reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, forests are the main force for absorbing carbon dioxide and play a vital role in the sustainable development of energy.

    <p class="envrionment-text">The forests in each area were severely damaged, the vegetation area in Australia was greatly weakened, many creatures died in the wildfires, the weather became worse, and the former holiday paradise became a barren ruin. The fires have devoured tens of thousands of forest areas, turning millennia-old forests into coke.

    <h2>How much carbon dioxide emissions did Australia's bushfires produce?</h2>
    <p class= "emission-text">Ahead of the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, Australia's forests are thought to reabsorb all the carbon released by bushfires across the country. which means that forests achieve net-zero emissions. Now, however, scientists say global warming is making wildfires burn more intensely and more frequently, believing that the 2019-2020 fires have released about 350 million tonnes (390 million short tons) of carbon dioxide - as much as two-thirds of Australia's average annual CO2 emissions (530 million tonnes (580 million short tons) October-December 2019. University of Tasmania Professor of thermal geography and fire science David Bowman warns: With so much damage caused by the fires, it could take more than 100 years for Australia's forests to reabsorb the carbon released by this year's fire season, he said.

      <p class="forest-text">In January 2020, the UK Met Office said Australia's 2019-2020 bushfires are expected to lead to a 2% increase in atmospheric concentrations of the main greenhouse gas, expected to reach 417 ppm, the largest annual increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide on record. Climate research has shown that conditions leading to extreme bushfires in Australia will only get worse as more greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere.

      <h3>Prevention</h3>
      <p class="future-text">Do a good job in fire prevention, make timely observation reports on forests, and do fire drills to prevent people from losing their homes due to fires. Observe and prevent fires in a timely manner, control the trend of fire spread, and prepare for the evacuation of people and animals</p>

      <h3>Process</h3>
      <p class="future-text">When a fire occurs, fire prevention should be carried out in time to prevent the fire from spreading too much, strengthen the awareness of forest fire prevention and control, and if necessary, conduct human intervention in a timely manner according to the situation to prevent excessive losses.

    <h2>For the future</h2>
    <p class="sum-text">We have indeed seen all kinds of harm caused by fires. Those lost energy, houses and animals have brought a lot of blow to Australia, and it has also reminded us that we cannot sit still when the accident expands, otherwise it will bring more serious damage. as a result of. But with the passing of the wildfires, we have also seen new life bred after the wildfires. I believe that in the near future, we will be able to get back on our feet and make up for the mistakes and regrets we have made now.</p></p>
